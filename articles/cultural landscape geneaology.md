### cultural landscape disciplinary geneaology
Sauer
-----
"The term 'landscape' is proposed to denote the unit concept of geography, to characterize the peculiarly geographic association of facts.""
"...an area made up of a distinct association of forms, both physical and cultural"
"one has not fully understood the nature of an area (landscape) until one “has learned to see it as an organic unit, to comprehend land and life in terms of each other."
"The geographer may describe the individual landscape as a type or possibly as a variant from type, but always he has in mind the generic, and proceeds by comparison."
"An ordered presentation of the landscapes of the earth is a formidable undertaking. Beginning with infinite diversity, salient and related features are selected in order to establish the character of the landscape and to place it in a system"
"Geography was formerly idiographic; it has long since attempted to become nomothetic, and no geographer would hold it at its previous level."
"It is true that in the selection of the generic characteristics of landscape the geographer is guided only by his own judgment that they are characteristic; that is, repeating; that they are arranged into a pattern, or have structural quality; and that the landscape accurately belongs to a specific group in the general series of landscapes."
"The geographer is in fact continually exercising freedom of choice as to the materials he includes in his observations, but he is also continually drawing inferences as to their relation. His method, imperfect as it may be, is based on induction; he deals with sequences, though he may not regard these as a simple causal relation."
"the personal element...operates in choosing the qualities to be represented. All that can be expected is the reduction of the personal element by agreement on a “predetermined mode of inquiry,” which shall be logical."
e.g. "A correct representation of the surface form, of soil, and of surficially conspicuous masses of rock, of plant cover and water bodies, of the coasts and the sea, of areally conspicuous animal life and of the expression of human culture is the goal of geographic inquiry."
"...we select those qualities of landscape in particular that are or may be of use to us. The physical qualities of landscape are those that have habitat value, present or potential."
"For the first half of the content of landscape we may use the designation “site"...The second half of landscape viewed as a bilateral unit is its cultural expression. There is a strictly geographic way of thinking of culture; namely, as the impress of the works of man upon the area"
[KG: this sounds uni-directional, or limiting. The products/works of humans are not limited to things that can be observed within a setting]
"It [the morphologic method] is a purely evidential system, without presupposition regarding the meaning of its evidence. Being objective and value-free, or nearly so, it is competent to arrive at increasingly significant results."
"Morphologic method is not only the introduction to the biologic sciences, but it is steadily growing in importance in the social fields. In biology it is the study of organic forms and their structure, or the architecture of organisms. In the social field the continued synthesis of phenomena by morphologic method has been employed with greatest success perhaps in anthropology. This science can claim an honor roll of workers who have had the patience and skill to approach the study of social institutions phenomenologically, by the classification of forms, ranging from the concrete materials of clothing, housing, and tools to the language and customs of a group, thereby identifying step by step the complex structure of cultures."
[KG: this is what hooks me. it is not Sauer's immediate project but he acknowledges the study of culture (anthropology) is directly connected with landscape. He states that Spengler ('brilliant and highly controversial') has been excessive in application of the morphologic method to history, but only in degree.]
"Ritter...laid the foundations for comparative regional study"
"all the facts of the subject are to be organized by a general system, through which alone their relation may be determined."
parphrasing: describing and registering are the first step
"If systematic description is a desideratum for geography, we are still in great need of enlarging our descriptive vocabulary."
cf. Passarge, "Beschreibende Landschaftskunde"
"The works of man express themselves in the cultural landscape...They are derived in each case from the natural landscape, man expressing his place in nature as a distinct agent of modification."

Sauer's natural landscape 
-------------------------
"...becomes known through the totality of its forms."
"each landscape being a definite combination of form values"
[KG: a signature you might say	]

Climate ("atmospheric features")
Land
	surface
	soil
	drainage (hydrology generally)
	mineral resource
Sea and coast ("currents, surface conditions, density, and temperatures")
Vegetation

Sauer's cultural landscape
--------------------------
"The extension of morphology to the cultural landscape"
"The study of the cultural landscape is, as yet, largely an untilled field."
"The cultural landscape is the geographic area in the final meaning (Chore). Its forms are all the works of man that characterize the landscape. Under this definition we are not concerned in geography with the energy, customs, or beliefs of man but with man’s record upon the landscape"
[KG: not me, nor myriad cultural geographers and historians]
Population
	density
	mobility
Housing
	plan
	structure
Production
Communication [KG: hmmm]

"Within the wide limits of the physical equipment of area lie many possible choices for man, as Vidal never grew weary of pointing out."
"Yet it is significant that there are others, and among them some of the best, who believe that, having observed widely and charted diligently, there yet remains a quality of understanding at a higher plane that may not be reduced to formal process."
"Vidal de la Blache’s thesis that in the relation of man to the earth there exists less of necessary adaptation than of “possibilism” is worked out with skill and conviction."










ChatGPT review of below materials:
"Cultural landscape is a key object (and interpretive stance) within a broader set of attempts—historical ecology among them—to build an integrated account of human–environment co-production across time, without reductionism or determinism."


Historical Ecology
------------------
from wikipedia _historical ecology_ article:
- "Those tasks require theory and methods drawn from geography, biology, ecology, history, sociology, anthropology, and other disciplines.
- "In historical ecology, the landscape is defined as an area of interaction between human culture and the non-human environment."
- "revises the notion of the ecosystem and replaces it with the landscape"
- "This recognition of landscapes as forms of knowledge is central to historical ecology, which studies landscapes from an anthropocentric perspective."
- "Sauer's pioneering 1925 paper "The Morphology of Landscape" is now fundamental to many disciplines and defines the domain."

"Studies labelled as historical ecology have been produced in at least four academic disciplines: history, ecology, geography and anthropology" 
"this field of study has no unified methodology, specialized institutional background and common publication forums"
"two main trends (ecological and anthropological) in historical ecological research"
term used since 1st half of 20c
variously since 19c: landscape history, environmental history, historical geography, environmental archaeology, forest history or historical ecology
for all: "the historical interconnectedness of nature and human culture"
"Annales historians were mainly active in promoting long-term social and economic history in opposition to traditional political history. Interpreting the study of the past in the widest possible sense (total history), one of their many contributions was to introduce the environment (physical as well as living) as a subject of investigations in rural history (Ford, 2001; Locher & Quenet, 2009)."

"A working definition of landscape is the spatial manifestation of the human-environment relation"
KG: are all landscapes then cultural landscapes?
"The landscape “scale” is thus powerfully integrative, enabling the simultaneous study of both the physical environment and human activity, and leading the investigation of factors that helped form a landscape—such as its geology, or an historical event, or an invasive speciesto data aggregated at other scales"
"The unique characteristics of every place challenge researchers to integrate a congeries of empirical environmental and cultural information. This necessarily requires the abandonment of notions of “nested” variables—often collectively termed hierarchies—common in biology and appropriated by other disciplines."
"Complex systems theory offers a means by which this nonhierarchical, nonlinear organization may be conceived in the term heterarchy"
"...historical ecology begins with the presumption that contemporary landscapes are the result of multiple factors that have interacted in complex ways throughout history,"
"Perhaps the most important characteristic of historical ecology is that it celebrates the open-minded quest of scientific inquiry, the phenomenological intensity of the human experience of place, and the empirical basis for both."
"...contemporary complex systems research, which offers a means by which human history and culture can be accommodated in a biophysical framework without reductionism"
"We must search for common ground, in relatively new terrain and on relatively neutral terms. The term environment must encompass the built environment, the cultural landscape, and nature wild and tame. The definition of ecology must include humans as a component of all ecosystems. The term history must include that of the Earth system as well as the social and physical past of our species."
"Without environmental and cultural information at local and regional scales, there exists no opportunity to test and refine global models"
"We must review a description of the world that is solely mechanistic and denies spirituality as an essential characteristic of the human species."
