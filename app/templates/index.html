  <p><strong><em>Computing Place</em></strong> is research infrastructure for environmental and cultural profiling of historical places. The core idea: places exist at the intersection of environmental constraints and cultural agency. Every location has an environmental signature&mdash;shaped by drainage basins, elevation, climate, and ecoregions&mdash;but cultural narratives and historical developments follow their own logic. By computing both signatures systematically and comparing how they align or diverge, we enable new forms of spatial and &lsquo;placial&rsquo; analysis for gazetteers, historical databases, and digital humanities projects.</p>

  <p>The platform is being developed modularly. <strong>EDOP</strong> (Environmental Dimensions of Place) is the first component, now live with 190,000+ watershed profiles using HydroATLAS data, digital elevation models, and ecoregion classifications. <strong>CDOP</strong> (Cultural Dimensions of Place) will add semantic and anthropological dimensions through text embeddings and ethnographic datasets. The full Computing Place platform will integrate these complementary signals, offering APIs and interactive tools that existing spatial humanities infrastructures can consume to enrich their place records with environmental context.</p>
