# ICH within the Computing Place Initiative  
## A Research Agenda for Cultural Dimensions of Place (CDOP)

*Working draft for internal reflection and collaborator discussion*

## 1. Positioning Statement

UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) data clearly constitutes **cultural dimensions of place**, but it does not natively support consistent or interpretable *practice-locality footprints* in the way that ethnographically anchored datasets (e.g., D-PLACE) do.

Accordingly:

- ICH belongs squarely within **CDOP**, not as a poor cousin of EDOP, but as a complementary cultural corpus.
- Direct correlation with basin-level environmental signatures is **possible only for a subset** of cases and should never be assumed as a default.
- The primary analytical value of ICH lies in its ability to illuminate **diffusion, affiliation, portability, and environmental perception**, rather than environmental causation (heaven forbid) or strong interdependency.

This agenda treats ICH not as a problem to be “fixed,” but as a dataset that forces CDOP to articulate its epistemic limits clearly.

## 2. Native Characteristics of ICH Data

### 2.1 Spatial Form
ICH elements exhibit **discontinuous, heterogeneous spatial footprints**, typically composed of:

- Practice locations (often sub-country, unevenly specified)
- Diaspora locations (explicitly mentioned and culturally meaningful)
- Recognition geographies (state parties, multinational inscriptions)

No single polygon adequately represents an ICH element.

### 2.2 Temporal Form
- Inscription years indicate **recognition moments**, not observation dates.
- Practices are framed as “living heritage,” often deliberately de-temporalized in nomination texts.

### 2.3 Textual Richness
- Nomination documents provide dense, structured narratives of cultural practice, history, and environmental context.
- Environmental references reflect **perceived and narrated landscapes**, not measured variables.

## 3. Two-Track Research Strategy

### Track A: EDOP-Linkable Subset (Selective, Explicit)

**Goal:** Explore whether *some* ICH elements plausibly associate with environmental signatures, without overclaiming.

#### A.1 Linkability Tiers
Elements can be categorized by spatial precision:

1. **Tier 1 – Explicit coordinates**  
   (Rare but high-confidence; suitable for basin/ecoregion linkage)
2. **Tier 2 – High-specificity practice locations**  
   (Villages/towns with admin context; geocodeable with effort)
3. **Tier 3 – Country-only or diffuse**  
   (Not suitable for EDOP correlation)

Only Tiers 1–2 should ever be used for EDOP-style experiments.

#### A.2 Outputs
- Linkability score per element
- Environmental envelope summaries (with confidence flags)
- Negative results explicitly documented

This track exists to *test plausibility*, not to guarantee results.

---

### Track B: ICH-Native CDOP Analyses (Primary)

**Goal:** Exploit what ICH does uniquely well as cultural data.

#### B.1 Diffusion and Cultural Spheres
- Multinational inscriptions as diffusion signals
- Bipartite graphs (element ↔ country)
- Community detection revealing cultural spheres (e.g., Turkic, Mediterranean, MENA)

#### B.2 Portability vs Environmental Binding
Develop a **portability index** based on:
- Number of recognizing countries
- Environmental diversity of recognition geographies
- Presence and extent of diaspora locations
- Degree to which environmental features are functionally central in text

This reframes the environment question as:
> Which practices appear environmentally constrained, and which are highly portable?

#### B.3 Environmental Perception and Salience
Treat environmental descriptions in nomination texts as:
- Cultural perceptions of landscape
- Narratives of constraint, affordance, sacredness, risk, or isolation

This supports comparative analysis of *how* environments are culturally framed.

#### B.4 Precision as Cultural Signal
Spatial precision itself may correlate with:
- Territorial boundedness of practice
- Institutional safeguarding strategies
- Political or cultural sensitivity

Precision becomes an analytical dimension, not just metadata.

## 4. Exemplar-Based Development

Rather than pursuing uniform global coverage, CDOP should identify:

- ~25–50 **exemplar elements** spanning:
  - High-precision hearth cases
  - Hearth + diaspora hybrids
  - Highly diffused multinational practices

These exemplars function as:
- Methodological testbeds
- Demonstration cases
- Anchors for collaboration discussions

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Computing Place Modules

### 5.1 EDOP
- EDOP-style correlation is appropriate only for selected ICH subsets.
- Results should be framed as *conditional experiments*, not general claims.

### 5.2 D-PLACE
- Used as a comparative anchor for “deep place” societies.
- Linkages treated as **bridge experiments**, not full integration.

### 5.3 Gazetteers / WHG
- Reconciliation is interpretive, not purely technical.
- Geocoding confidence and ambiguity must be surfaced.

## 6. What ICH Contributes to Computing Place

ICH strengthens the Computing Place initiative by:

- Forcing explicit treatment of spatial ambiguity
- Highlighting culture as mobile, relational, and narrated
- Providing a counterpoint to environmentally anchored datasets
- Enabling analyses of diffusion, recognition, and portability

In short: ICH helps define **what Computing Place can and cannot claim**, which is a feature, not a weakness.

## 7. Near-Term Pragmatic Focus (Contextual Note)

Given current priorities and upcoming discussions with ISHI / WHG:

- Deep CDOP development can proceed asynchronously.
- Immediate emphasis remains on:
  - Environmental signatures
  - LLM-generated summaries
  - On-demand consumption in Place Portal pages
- ICH work can be positioned as a *parallel, forward-looking research strand* rather than a core dependency.

---

## 8. Open Questions (for Future Iteration)

- What minimum confidence threshold should be required before EDOP linkage?
- How should diaspora be visualized without implying practice displacement?
- Can environmental perception narratives be standardized enough for comparison?
- Which ICH-derived metrics are genuinely useful to historians using Place Portals?
