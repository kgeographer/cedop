Environmental Dimensions of Place (EDOP)

Overview

Environmental Dimensions of Place (EDOP) is a research-driven infrastructure project that exposes structured environmental (and exploratory semantic) descriptors for named places. It is designed as a service layer that can complement narrative place description in the World Historical Gazetteer, without constraining editorial practice or interpretive plurality.

At its simplest, EDOP can be understood as a machine-actionable counterpart to the “place setting blurb” on WHG Place Portal pages: derived automatically, grounded in established datasets, and reusable via APIs.

EDOP currently provides

1. Environmental place signatures (core)

EDOP generates environmental profiles for places, derived from global river basin and environmental datasets (currently BasinAtlas / HydroATLAS). Each profile is organized into four deliberately separated persistence bands:
	1.	Physiographic bedrock – long-term geological and topographic context
	2.	Hydro-climatic baselines – drainage, runoff, aridity, climatic constraints
	3.	Bioclimatic proxies – climate-derived indicators relevant to vegetation and productivity
	4.	Anthropocene markers – modern land use, population, and human modification

These bands differ in temporal stability and historiographical applicability, allowing selective use by period and research question. The output is not a single score or label, but a structured, comparable environmental signature.


2. Semantic place signatures (experimental)

In parallel, EDOP explores semantic signatures derived from textual description. Current experiments use summarized Wikipedia text for a curated set of global cities, separated into historical, cultural, environmental, and modern bands, and embedded for similarity analysis.

This work is explicitly exploratory and replaceable: source corpora and models are imperfect, and results are intended to provoke ideas rather than serve as authoritative classifications. Importantly, the environmental service layer does not depend on this semantic component.


Relation to WHG

EDOP is so far conceived primarily as an API-based service. A web platform providing analytica tools is a possibility.

In the WHG context, one or more EDOP endpoints could:
	•	accept a place geometry or identifier,
	•	return a structured environmental profile,
	•	support comparison across places or regions.

Such a service could enhance existing place pages, support discovery and comparison, and be reused across other projects without requiring new editorial workflows or bespoke UI development.


Current status

EDOP is already functional in prototype form:
	•	Global sub-basin environmental profiles are computed and queryable.
	•	Environmental signatures can be attached to point locations.
	•	Semantic embeddings have been generated for 258 global cities.
	•	A lightweight web interface exists solely as a research and exploration aid.
